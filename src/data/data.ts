			"Sometimes the old is the new, especially when it comes toâ€¦you know, mechanical keyboards. Designed around a 75% layout with a heavy dose of dieselpunk elements, including a metal handlebar, a metal knob for volume control, and 70's DIP mode switch, the asymmetrical design oozes with mechanicity, which along with the RGB lights exuded from the three portholes situated at the bottom, transports you to an era when men and women with keyboards were constantly on a mission, probably to where no one has gone before.",
